Your character traits are based on your personality, morals, ethics and beliefs. Knowing your best character traits can help you to develop them further and use them to your advantage in your career, from writing a compelling resume or cover letter to requesting a promotion. In this article, we define 13 character traits that can boost your career.

What are character traits?
Character traits are aspects of your behavior that may be valued by the community or society. They are often used in the context of specific situations, such as encountering an opportunity or a challenge. For example, think of your favorite hero in a book or movie you enjoy. How does this person act under pressure? How do they behave when others are in trouble? The words you would use to describe these behaviors, such as brave, caring and honest, are character traits.

Why are character traits important in the workplace?
When you know your best character traits, you can work to strengthen them. This can help you in a multitude of ways from advancing your career and achieving goals to developing relationships and growing your professional network.

Character traits can also help you make decisions that align with your values. For example, you might identify with being courageous, and as a result, you could be more inclined to stand up for what you believe in or make a tough call at work.

Leveraging character traits in your job search
Review the traits below and carefully consider which of them you possess or identify with. Once you know your best attributes, be sure to address them in your resume, cover letter and interviews.

Character traits in your resume
You can weave your character traits into your resume summary by including language such as, “4+ years of experience building creative solutions for an enterprise sales team.” Also include them in your work experience descriptions. For example, you could include a bullet point that reads, “Maintained flexibility during company-wide restructure due to COVID-19 and implemented successful work from home processes under a tight deadline.”

Character traits in your cover letter
When writing a cover letter, you should display character traits that are relevant to the job. For instance, if you’re applying to a role in customer service, you might highlight a time you exercised patience and compassion.

Character traits in your interview
You should also work your best character traits into your responses to behavioral and situational interview questions such as “what are your greatest strengths,” or “tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge.” Remember, it’s important to be specific when answering interview questions, so strive to share stories and experiences of times when you exhibited these traits in a professional setting.

Highlighting character traits for career advancement
Additionally, when your employer can recognize your character traits, it gives them a better sense of your strengths. Your character traits can provide insight to how you might perform new job duties, communicate with peers, manage stress and handle high-pressure situations.

For example, if your employer is seeking to promote someone to a management position and you are interested in the opportunity, you might bring to their attention that you are perceptive, empathetic, motivational and strategic. These specific traits are characteristic of someone who can identify the needs of their team, understand their pain points, drive them to reach goals and determine the best next steps to achieve company objectives.
